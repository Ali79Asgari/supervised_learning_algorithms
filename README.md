# Supervised Learning Algorithms in Python - From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of key **Supervised Learning algorithms** written from scratch in Python. Each algorithm is designed without the use of high-level machine learning libraries, allowing for a deeper understanding of their inner workings.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Supervised learning is a fundamental aspect of machine learning where models are trained on labeled data. This repository covers essential algorithms for both **regression** and **classification tasks** while explaining their underlying mathematical principles.

The goals of this project are to:
- Provide clear implementations of popular supervised learning algorithms.
- Emphasize the mathematics and logic behind each algorithm.
- Help users understand how these algorithms operate by walking through the code.
